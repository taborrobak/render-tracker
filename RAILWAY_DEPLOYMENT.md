2. **Deploy Phase**:
   - Starts with: `uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
   - Database auto-initializes with 1000 test jobs
   - Health check endpoint becomes available

3. **Runtime**:
   - WebSocket connections work automatically
   - Static files served properly
   - Real-time job updates functional

### ðŸ›  Features Available After Deployment:

âœ… **Full Job Management** - View, filter, update job statuses
âœ… **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket connections for live data
âœ… **Bulk Operations** - Reset flagged jobs, status management
âœ… **Responsive UI** - Nord-themed, mobile-friendly interface
âœ… **API Endpoints** - RESTful API for external integrations
